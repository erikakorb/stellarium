This repository contains scripts to automate the sky visualization with [Stellarium](https://stellarium.org/). 

At the moment, the is only the `equinox' script that allows to visualize the equinox precession. It also allows to highlight or hid specific constellations or lines (e.g. ecliptica) during the presentation. The script was developed for Stellarium v.019.3 through the [Stellarium API](https://stellarium.org/doc/head/scripting.html).

To use the plugin, download the .ssc file into the local Stellarium plugin folder.
